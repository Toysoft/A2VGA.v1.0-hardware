This project is a hardware implementation of the work done by Mark Aikens and David kuder on the VGA analog card for Apple2.

The card is based on RPI Pico, 4x 74LVC245 chips and a PLD. The improvement is that an ATF22V10 is used which has sufficient I/O pins to allow that 11 bits of the address are decoded for correct switching off of the ExtROM, in case the RPI firmware is using this memory.
